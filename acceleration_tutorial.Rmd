# Tutorial objectives

The goal of this tutorial is to explore how to fit hidden Markov models to accelerometer data, incorporate covariates into the transition probabilities, and use a classic model selection criteria to select the "best" model out of different candidates.

The goal of this tutorial is to explore fitting hidden Markov models to accelerometer data, incorporate covariates into the transition probabilities, and select for the best candidate model. We use 4 days of acceleration data obtained from a free-ranging blacktip reef shark at Palmyra Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean (data taken from Leos-Barajas et al. 2017). Specificly, the following topics wil be covered throughout this tutorial:

  - Resampling data (Down sampling) (???)
  - Reef shark basic HMM example
  - Adding covariates
  - Visualization (Depth time series with decoded states?)


# Accelerometer data

Accelerometer devices measure up to three axes, which can be described relative to the body of the animal: longitudinal (surge), lateral (sway) and dorsoventral (heave). These devices are becoming more prevalent in the fields of animal biologging data as they provide a means of measuring activity in a meaningful and quantitative way. From tri-axial acceleration data, we can also derive several measures that summarize effort or exertion and relate acceleration  to activity levels such as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA).

```{r,fig.align='center',echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("ODBA_pic.png")


```

ODBA and VeDBA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of three-dimension acceleration data while retaining important information. Further, because acceleration data is often at high temporal resolutions over time, it also naturally exhibits a large degree of autocorrelation, making it impossible to assume independence between sequential observations. HMMs can account for the autocorrelation present in the data while assuming that the data were generated according to a finite set of (unobserved) behaviors making them a good candidate model for this type of data structure. For the blacktip shark, we have time of day, water temperature, depth (in meters) and ODBA.

```{r}
# R packages that will be used for this tutorial
library(readr)
library(momentuHMM)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)


# Load data 
BlacktipB <- read_delim("BlacktipB.txt", 
                        delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                        trim_ws = TRUE)

```


Looking at the ODBA values throughout the observed period, we find ODBA is unusually high at some times -- for this shark we assumed that values between 0 and 2 were consistent with what we expected. The dashed red line in the plot below corresponds to a ODBA value of 2, so those values that are above this line correspond to these high ODBA values throught the observed time period:

```{r, fig.height= 4, fig.width=12,echo=F}

BlacktipB_aux = BlacktipB %>% 
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(Time,format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")) #%>% 
  # mutate(hour_to_sec =  as.integer(seconds(hm(format(Time, format = "%H:%M"))))) %>%
  # group_by(Time) %>% mutate(sec = row_number()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
  # mutate(sec = case_when(hour_to_sec == 53160 ~ as.integer(sec + 55),
  #                        TRUE ~ sec),
  #        hour_to_sec = hour_to_sec + sec)

BlacktipB_aux %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Time,ODBA)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_hline(yintercept = 2,linetype="dashed",color="red")
```

Because accommodating extreme values can pose a problem for identification of an adequate state-dependent distribution in our HMM, we removed them from the data set. However, note that in general, deciding whether to remove extreme values or not will more likely depend on whether we find appropriate distributional forms that can accommodate them. Generally, we need to make sure that extreme values are in fact some artefact of the data collection process, not representative of a behavior of interest, or inconsistent with what we are trying to capture as well. Removing data is not good general practice but instead we can assess on a case-by-case basis. **For the interest of time, in this tutorial we will be working with the 1-minute average depth and ODBA values** -- this decrease significantly the amount of time required for the model fitting stage.

```{r}

# Transform into proper time format and take 1-min avg
BlacktipB_1min = BlacktipB %>% filter(ODBA <= 2) %>%  
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(Time,format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")) %>% 
  group_by(Time = cut(Time, breaks = "1 min")) %>%
  summarise(ODBA_avg = mean(ODBA),
            temp_avg = mean(Temp),
            depth_avg = mean(Depth)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(Time,format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) %>%
  as.data.frame()
  
head(BlacktipB_1min)
```


# Model fitting

We can see the 1-minute-mean time series here across the four days: 

```{r,echo=F, fig.height= 4, fig.width=12}
BlacktipB_1min %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Time,ODBA_avg)) + 
  geom_line() 
```


After data cleansing, we are ready to start proposing candidate models for this data!

Given our data, we are interested in finding possible behaviours through the observation process (ODBA). Let's take a quick look at the histogram of the observations.

```{r, echo=F}
hist(BlacktipB_1min$ODBA_avg, 
     breaks = 80, 
     main="Histogram of ODBA", 
     xlab = "ODBA")
```


The best way to start when fitting a hidden Markov model is to moving from simple models to more complex ones. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be considering 2 behavioural states, with gamma state-dependent distributions -- these two states can be interpreted as proxies for "high-activity" behaviour and "low-activity" behaviour. As well, no additonal data will be incorporated in the state-switching dynamics -- which translates in not including covariances in the transition probabilities allocated in the transition probability matrix. `MomentumHMM` requires we propose initial values in order to perform the model fitting. For the choice of initial parameter values, performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be a good starting point. From the plots above, considering mean values of 0.001 and 0.003 for the high-activity behaviour and low-activity behaviour to be assigned to our state-dependent distributions seems to be reasonable. As part of the data preparation, we need to process the data using the prepData function, which will assign the class `momentuHMMData` to our dataframe. This will allow us to use the functions provided by `momentuHMM`.

```{r}
BlacktipBData = prepData(BlacktipB_1min,coordNames = NULL)
```

Let's fit our model and observe the output. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
fit1 = fitHMM(BlacktipBData,
              nbStates=2,
              dist=list(ODBA_avg="gamma"),
              Par0 = list(ODBA_avg=c(.001,.003,1,1)))

fit1
```

We can also plot the results to obtain a visual representation of the fitted model.

```{r}
plot(fit1,breaks = 80)
```

Let's look at the pseudo-residuals.

```{r, fig.height= 4, fig.width=12}
plotPR(fit1)
```

We can also compute the most likely sequence of states.

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width=12,cache=TRUE}
# identify most likely state using the Viterbi algorithm
BlacktipB_1min$state <- factor(viterbi(fit1))

# proportion of the behaviour states during the observed period
table(BlacktipB_1min$state)/length(BlacktipB_1min$state)

BlacktipB_1min %>% mutate(day = day(Time)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time,ODBA_avg)) +
  #facet_wrap(~day,scales = "free_x") +
  geom_line(alpha=.1) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=state,color=state))

```

Let's include retryFits in the fitHMM function. This can take time to run.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(147)
fit1_s2 <- fitHMM(BlacktipBData,
                  nbState = 2,
                  dist=list(ODBA_avg="gamma"),
                  Par0 = list(ODBA_avg=c(.001,.003,1,1)),
                  retryFits=10)
fit1_s2
```

Seems nothing changed at all!

Now let's go further and include a high perturbation in one of the initial values (instead of .001 and .003, let's do .001 and 1). Do we still have similar estimated coefficients and log likelihood? (no matter the initial values, the coefficients should be similar)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
fit1_s2_long <- fitHMM(BlacktipBData,
                  nbState = 2,
                  dist=list(ODBA_avg="gamma"),
                  Par0 = list(ODBA_avg=c(.001,1,1,1)))

fit1_s2_long
```

Let's look at the pseudo-residuals.

```{r, fig.height= 4, fig.width=12}
plotPR(fit1_s2_long)
```

You may get warnings.

We can see that there is high autocorrelation and some deviation from normality.

We can also compute the most likely sequence of states. What can we infer from this? Is there something else we can say from this? According to fitted model, can we see if there is any interesting pattern?

```{r, fig.height= 6, fig.width=12}
# identify most likely state using the Viterbi algorithm
BlacktipB_1min$state_wildPar0 <- factor(viterbi(fit1_s2_long))

# proportion of the behaviour states during the observed period
table(BlacktipB_1min$state_wildPar0)/length(BlacktipB_1min$state_wildPar0)

# BlacktipB_1min %>% mutate(day = day(Time)) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(Time,state_wildPar0)) + facet_wrap(~day) + geom_point()

BlacktipB_1min %>% mutate(day = day(Time)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time,ODBA_avg)) +
  #facet_wrap(~day,scales = "free_x") +
  geom_line(alpha=.1) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=state_wildPar0,color=state_wildPar0))


```

Here we can see that there is only one state when we use these new starting values, this is an indication that there may be problems.

# Incorporating covariates

As in Leos-Barajas et al. 2017, we can incorporate other information that may help explain the values of ODBA. In this case, we consider the minute of the day of every observation. Time of day is represented by two trigonometric functions with period 24 h, $cos(2\pi (t/60)/24)$ and $sin(2\pi (t/60)/24$. Using the function cosinor, we can convert our data stream to something that is useful for us. As well, we need to provide the formula corresponding to the regression that will be stored in the transition probability values.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# formula corresponding to the regression coefficients for the transition probabilities
# re-prep data
BlacktipB_1min <- BlacktipB_1min %>%
  mutate(lag = 0:(n() - 1),
         sin_part = sin(2*pi*lag*(1/60)/24),
         cos_part = cos(2*pi*lag*(1/60)/24)
         )

BlacktipBData = prepData(BlacktipB_1min,coordNames = NULL, covNames = c("sin_part", "cos_part"))

# re-fit model 1
fit1 = fitHMM(BlacktipBData,nbStates=2,dist=list(ODBA_avg="gamma"),Par0 = list(ODBA_avg=c(.1,.3,1,1)))


formula = ~ sin_part + cos_part
Par0_fit2 <- getPar0(model=fit1, 
                     formula=formula)

fit2 = fitHMM(BlacktipBData,nbStates=2,dist=list(ODBA_avg="gamma"),Par0 = Par0_fit2$Par,formula=formula)

fit2
```


```{r, cache=TRUE}
plot(fit2,breaks=80)
```

Let's explore the results. Do the coefficients vary much? What about the ACF? Did the autocorrelation decrease with this innovation?

```{r, fig.height= 4, fig.width=12}
plotPR(fit2)
```

# Model section: Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)

Akaike information criteria (AIC) is a model selection criteria to select models. In a few words, the higher, the better (or equivalently, since values are always negative, the closer to zero, the better).
We can also take a quick look at the Akaike information criteria (AIC) for the two models to do a comparison. 

```{r}
AIC(fit1)
AIC(fit2)
```


# Exercise

Reproduce the analysis from the blacktip shark data, but now consider three beahviour states instead of only two. 

  - Is there any significant difference in ACF compared to the initial 2-state HMM? 
  - Now include the variable `hour_to_sec` as a covariate and refit your extended model. What are the AIC and the log-likelihood values? Based on the Akaike Information Criteria, which seems to be the "best" model? 

**Note:** In the case that you have your own data, feel free to use the code provided for th blacktip shark data analysis and adapt it to analyse your data. Explore!
